<h2 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h2>
<p>Given that have gone back to school and changed careers, I do not
have a lot of formal software engineering work experience yet. My
Master‚Äôs degree has been the better part of three years of work. While
much of my graduate work was self-directed it was paid for with funding
and scholarships from the University of Lethbridge and my supervisors. I
treated it as much as a full time job as was possible.</p>
<p>My other formal work experience came over two summers during my
Bachelor‚Äôs degree at the University of Lethbridge. Both of these jobs
were assisting with research projects as a programmer.</p>

<h2 id="personal-projects">Personal Projects</h2>
<p>Since discovering computer programming I have built a lot of things
for fun and learning. I have listed many of them below. Some are more
finished than others and a few are school projects or extensions of
school projects. A few of them are even somewhat useful üòÅ.</p>
<h3 id="interpreters-compilers-and-vms">Interpreters, Compilers, and
VMs</h3>
<p>If there is one computer science topic I love the most it is
programming languages and their implementations. The simple fact that I
can give the computer instructions is pretty amazing, but combine that
with all the abstractions and paradigms that can be added on top of
those simple instructions. As a result I have spent a fair amount of
time implementing and adjusting programming languages.</p>
<p>I really enjoy Lisp-like languages and this is where many of my
personal attempts at interpreters and compilers have been focused.
Lisp-like languages are also slightly more straightforward to parse,
which can make them easier to get started with. With that simplicity
comes a lot of power though and a lot of room for fun or practical
extensions.</p>
<p>In the end though all of my projects are only for fun and personal
learning. I am sure it is possible to make an efficient, full-featured,
and robust programming language on my own, but it is not really
practical. There are so many amazing languages out there that many
people have spent many years refining. So, each of my projects have only
been taken so far.</p>

<h3 id="command-line-tools">Command Line Tools</h3>
<p>I have also made a few command line programs and tools over the years
to help me accomplish a task or just to learn something and practice
programming. I don‚Äôt often have a need that cannot be met by an existing
project, but it is fun to be able to build something useful.</p>

<p>Like everyone that has learned to program I have made a few video
games. I find I am generally more interested in creating the games
architecture and algorithms than I am in writing a compelling and fun
video game. As a result I have not really spent that much time making
video games. Below are two projects that I put the most time and effort
into.</p>
