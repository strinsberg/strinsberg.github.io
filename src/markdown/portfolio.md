# Strinsberg's Portfolio

<div class=abstract>
  This is a collection of my work and personal projects. It is a litte unfinished at the moment. I will add more descriptions, screenshots, and fix links to online demos for applicable projects.

## Work Experience

Given that I have changed careers and gone back to school in my 30s, I do not have a lot of work experience yet. My Master's degree has been the better part of three years of work. While much of the work was self-directed it was paid for with funding and scholarships from the University of Lethbridge and my supervisors. So, I treated it as much as a full time job as was possible.

My other formal work experience came over two summers during my Bachelor's degree at the University of Lethbridge. Both of these jobs were assisting with research projects as a programmer.

## Personal Projects

Since discovering computer programming I have built a lot of things for fun and learning. I have listed many of them below. Some are more finished than others and a few are school projects or extensions of school projects. A few of them are even somewhat useful üòÅ.

### Interpreters, Compilers, and VMs

If there is one computer science topic I love the most it is programming languages and their implementations. The simple fact that I can give the computer instructions is pretty amazing, but combine that with all the abstractions and paradigms that can be added on top of those simple instructions. As a result I have spent a fair amount of time implementing and adjusting programming languages.

I really enjoy Lisp-like languages and this is where many of my personal attempts at interpreters and compilers have been focused. Lisp-like languages are also slightly more straightforward to parse, which can make them easier to get started with. With that simplicity comes a lot of power though and a lot of room for fun or practical extensions.

In the end though all of my projects are only for fun and personal learning. I am sure it is possible to make an efficient, full-featured, and robust programming language on my own, but it is not really practical. There are so many amazing languages out there that many people have spent many years refining. So, each of my projects have only been taken so far.

### Command Line Tools

I have also made a few command line programs and tools over the years to help me accomplish a task or just to learn something and practice programming. I don't often have a need that cannot be met by an existing project, but it is fun to be able to build something useful.

#### Easy Mark

#### Simple Text

### Games And Game Engines

Like everyone that has learned to program I have made a few video games. I find I am generally more interested in creating the games architecture and algorithms than I am in writing a compelling and fun video game. As a result I have not really spent that much time making video games. Below are two projects that I put the most time and effort into.

#### DGSL
