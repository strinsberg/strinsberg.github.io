    <hr>

    <p>Here are some of my favourite projects. The ones I had the most fun making,
    were the most useful, or I learned something from.


    <h3 id="space-match">Space Match 3000</h3>

    <p>Space Match is a very simple match 3 game.
    This is the first project I ever fully completed. It was really exciting to have
    something that looked like a real program, albiet a simple one. I finished it
    before I had decided to do a CS program full time and the fun I had was a big
    part of my decision.</p>

    <p><img src="images/space_match.jpg" alt="space match gameplay"></p>

    <p>I learned the lua programming language and how to work with
    a framework/library using love2d. I also learned that a programs architecture
    is a tricky and important part of the process. It is often easy to make things
    work, not as easy to do it in a way that makes building and extending the
    app pleasant. For this particular project I learned about the state pattern and
    used a simple vesion off it to split up game states into self contained logical
    units. Of course, I still barely new what I was doing so the code code is still
    not as clean as it could be.</p>

    <p>The project can be found on my GitHub here (add link). To see it in action a
    version converted for the web can be played here (add link).
    <strong>Note</strong> that the UI is a bit
    clumsy. Menus are navigated with the keyboard by pressing keys in brackets. I.e.
    <code>(n)ew game</code> is activated with <code>n</code>. However, during the game the mouse is used
    to select blocks to swap. It was not built with the web in mind so things like
    the high score don&rsquo;t really work.</p>


    <h2 id="about">More About Me</h2>

      <p>I love programming!</p>

      <p>Better add more to make sure everyone knows I am not a robot ðŸ˜‰</p>
