      <h1 id="main-title">Strinsberg's Pages :UNDER CONSTRUCTION: June 2020</h1>
      Soon to be my personal WebPage/Portfolio. When I have time to work on it.

        <ul>
          <li><h3>Simple Text</h3>
            A toy terminal text editor. It doesn't do much, but it is possible
            to edit text with it (for the most part).
            <br><br>
            You can download it and try it out... 
            <a href='static/bin/simple_text'>linux</a>
            <a href='static/bin/simple_text_mac'>mac</a>
            <a href='static/bin/simple_text.exe'>windows</a>
            <br><br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> On linux you may have to update file permissions with chmod.
            <br><br>
            <b>WARNING:</b> Simple text actively replaces all tabs with 4 spaces
            so do not open anything you wouldn't want this to happen to!!!
            You have been warned.
          </li>

          <li><h3>Space Match 3000</h3>
            The first project I ever finished is a simple match 3 game. It doesn't
            really have anything to do with space, but it was a fun name at the time.
            <br><br>
            You can give it a try here
            <a href="space_match_3000/index.html" target="_blank">SpaceMatch3000</a>
            or visit the
            <a href="https://github.com/strinsberg/space-match-3000"
              target="_blank">Github repo</a>
            to view the code. It wasn't really meant to be a web app, so it may
            take a little time to load.
            <br><br>
            Some simple instructions on how to play can be found in the game or on
            the Github Repo.
