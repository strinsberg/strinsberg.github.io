## Space Match 3000

Space Match is a very simple match 3 game.
This is the first project I ever fully completed. It was really exciting to have
something that looked like a real program, albiet a simple one. I finished it
before I had decided to do a CS program full time and the fun I had was a big
part of my decision.

I learned the lua programming language and how to work with
a framework/library using love2d. I also learned that a programs architecture
is a tricky and important part of the process. It is often easy to make things
work, not as easy to do it in a way that makes building and extending the
app pleasant. For this particular project I learned about the state pattern and
used a simple vesion off it to split up game states into self contained logical
units. Of course, I still barely new what I was doing so the code code is still
not as clean as it could be.

The project can be found on my GitHub here (add link). To see it in action a
version converted for the web can be played here (add link).
**Note** that the UI is a bit
clumsy. Menus are navigated with the keyboard by pressing keys in brackets. I.e.
`(n)ew game` is activated with `n`. However, during the game the mouse is used
to select blocks to swap. It was not built with the web in mind so things like
the high score don't really work.
